=========

Welcome to the documentation for mahler!

`mahler` is a web browser automation wrapper that offers a standard API regardless
of what automation suite is being used.

This allows for swapping between automation solutions (playwright, selenium)
without having to rewrite the actual browser control code.

`mahler` is named after `Gustav Mahler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler>`_,
a 19th century composer that wrote some `sweet bass solos <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEP2pA6srnk>`_.
