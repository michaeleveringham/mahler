## To Do

- Expand fingerprint dataclass and usage to capture and apply full browser fingerprint.
- Add some blackbox functional tests for browser engines.
- Async browser support. Selenium doesn't have a native async implementation and [`selenium-async`](https://github.com/munro/python-selenium-async)
is no longer maintained.
- Support request interception. [`selenium-wire`](https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire) is no longer maintained.
- Support [mokr](https://github.com/michaeleveringham/mokr) when it is fully released.
